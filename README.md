# Documentation-for-the-Cauchy-Peano-Theorem-Proof-and-Numerical-Methods-Mathematical-Methods-II-
Attached is a LaTeX source file containing the formal proof of the Cauchy-Peano Theorem. This documentation was developed as part of the Mathematical Methods II course within the B.S. in Physics program
Additionally, I have included two MATLAB (.m) files created during the course. These scripts were specifically designed to visualize and compare the following numerical and analytical approximations:
- Euler’s Polygonal Lines: Demonstrating the constructive approach used in Peano's existence proof.
- Picard Iterates: Illustrating the successive approximation method used to establish existence and uniqueness.

The scripts allow for a direct comparison of the convergence and behavior of both methods when applied to specific ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
